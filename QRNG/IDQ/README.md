## üîí IDQ Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG)

This module uses **ID Quantique (IDQ) quantum entropy** ‚Äî randomness sourced from fundamental quantum processes rather than algorithms or seeds.

IDQ is a world leader in commercial quantum security systems, and its QRNG technology is deployed in **enterprise-grade cryptography, banking security, and hardware quantum devices**.

### üß† How IDQ QRNG Works

IDQ's Quantum Random Number Generators use the **quantum behavior of individual photons**:

1. A single-photon source emits photons toward a beam-splitter
2. Each photon randomly picks **Path A or Path B**
3. A detector on each path registers arrival
4. The result (0 or 1) is fundamentally unpredictable
5. Post-processing removes physical bias without reducing entropy

This is **true quantum randomness** ‚Äî guaranteed by quantum mechanics and impossible to reproduce or predict.
