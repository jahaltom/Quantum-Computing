## ðŸ”’ What is the ANU Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG)?

The **Australian National University (ANU) QRNG** produces true randomness using the fundamental laws of quantum physics â€” not algorithms, seeds, or pseudo-random functions.

### ðŸ§  How it Works (Simple Overview)

At the quantum scale, empty space is not truly empty â€” it constantly fluctuates due to the **quantum vacuum**, causing unpredictable light intensity changes. ANU's QRNG:

1. **Shines a laser into a vacuum chamber**
2. **Measures quantum fluctuations (vacuum noise)**
3. **Converts these unpredictable photon variations into random bits**
4. **Applies randomness extraction + statistical validation**
5. **Streams the results as true quantum random numbers**

These fluctuations are **inherently unpredictable**, guaranteed by quantum mechanics â€” meaning **no classical process or attacker can predict the output**.

### âœ… Why It Matters

- Provides **physical entropy**, not mathematical simulation  
- Suitable for **cryptography, simulations, key generation, security research, and AI randomness experiments**
- Public API to stream true quantum randomness in real time
